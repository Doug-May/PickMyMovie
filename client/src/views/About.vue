        <p>It's estimated that the average man will wait approximately 17 hours per week waiting for his significant other to pick a dern movie to watch. That adds up to almost 40 days in every year.... just waiting. In the time you might spend waiting in one year for your wife/girlfriend to pick a movie, you could watch almost 500 movies! We want to end the suffering. Let us help you pick something quick.</p>
